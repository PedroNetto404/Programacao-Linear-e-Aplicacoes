# Thirty Class Project: 
Implementing the Simplex Method for Solving Linear Programming Problems

## Simplex Method:

The simplex method is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems. 
The method solves linear programming problems in which all variables are continuous.
It was created by George Dantzig in 1947.

## Getting Started:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
```bash
$ python --version
```
2. If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ or if you are using a Linux distribution, you can install it using the package manager of your distribution.
Example:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```
3. Clone the repo.
4. Set your problema in the standard form into the ./trabalho3/input.json file.
5. Run the main.py file.
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
6. The result will be displayed on the screen.
