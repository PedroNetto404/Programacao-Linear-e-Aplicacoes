# Linear Programming and Applications

This course is an introduction to linear programming and its applications. The course is divided into two parts: theoretical and practical. The theoretical part linear problems, startdard form, simplex method, revision of linear algebra and
more. The practical algorithms in python to solve linear programming problems.

# Linear Problems Def
The linear problem is a mathematical model that represents a situation in which the objective is to optimize a linear function subject to a set of linear constraints. The linear problem is represented by the following mathematical model:
- Objective Function: 
    - Maximize: c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + cn*xn
    - Minimize: c1*x1 + c2*x2 + ... + cn*xn
    - c1, c2, ..., cn are the coefficients of the objective function.
- Constraints:
    - a11*x1 + a12*x2 + ... + a1n*xn <= b1
    - a21*x1 + a22*x2 + ... + a2n*xn <= b2
    - ...
    - am1*x1 + am2*x2 + ... + amn*xn <= bm
    - aij are the coefficients of the constraints.
- Variables:
    - x1, x2, ..., xn

## Librarys and Tools

**Python** - Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
**Numpy** - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
**Guropipy** - Gurobi is the most powerful mathematical optimization solver out there. It is designed to solve large-scale mathematical optimization problems.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
```bash
$ python --version
```

2. If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ or if you are using a Linux distribution, you can install it using the package manager of your distribution.
3. Clone the repo.
4. You can run class projects in the folder trabalh[n] where n is the number of the project.
